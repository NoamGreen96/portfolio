### Styling

The styling of the website can be customized by modifying the Sass files. The main Sass file is located at `src/styles/main.scss`, and you can import additional stylesheets in this file as needed. The `variables.scss` file contains various variables that can be adjusted to change colors, fonts, and other design elements.
